function [features] = std_spectral_bands(window, Fs)
%STD_SPECTRAL_BANDS Standard deviation on specific spectral bands
%   Provides information about the distribution of harmonics in 
% these bands, which define if the harmonics are distributed along the band
% or if there are significant harmonics. It can give information about 
% stability or specific significant peaks in a band.

% extracting window data without time axis
window_data = window(:,2:10);
