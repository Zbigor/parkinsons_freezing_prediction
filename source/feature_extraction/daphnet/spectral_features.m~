% Standard deviation on specific spectral bands
%   Provides information about the distribution of harmonics in 
% these bands, which define if the harmonics are distributed along the band
% or if there are significant harmonics. It can give information about 
% stability or specific significant peaks in a band.

stdev_features = std(P1);

% Highest harmonic peaks  
% Useful for detecting concrete events in specific spectral bands
% (e.g. high peaks in 0.1Hz to 0.68 Hz band can be considered as a candidate to be a postural
% transition)
% Extracting 2 highest peaks

% finding max for each axis of each sensor
